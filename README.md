Neat little doodad for graphing cool patterns using some weird math I don't really understand.

Made as a foray into Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform, so it's probably kinda bad.


Run the `jsBrowserRun` gradle task and access the site at `localhost:8080`. 
Fiddle with the sliders to find some patterns.

### Slider 1:
Base pattern?

### Slider 2:
'Rotates' (?) the pattern.

### Slider 3:
Also rotates the pattern (???).

### Slider 4:
Zooms into the pattern? (Can also use your scroll wheel to adjust this value).

### Slider 5, 6, 7:
At one point, these also did something but I don't remember what that was.
